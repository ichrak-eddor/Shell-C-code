give access permission 

```bash
chmod u+x filename
```

Or run the shell in batch mode

with bat as a commands file

```bash

### *Makefile:*

You can compile and run the ***shellcode shell*** with the Makefile using the command below.  **This only works for the interactive mode.**

`~/codeshell% make shellcode`

After you finish testing the shellcode shell, you can clean up the unnecessary files in the folder with the following command:

`~/codeshell% make clear `
rm shellcode .codeshell
